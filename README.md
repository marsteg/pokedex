# Welcome to the Pokedex!
This is a small command-line Pokedex - built with the help of boot.dev

## Available Commands
- catch: Catch a Pokemon and add it to your Pokedex!
- inspect: Inspect a Pokemon with your Pokedex!
- map: The map command displays the names of 20 location areas in the Pokemon world. - mapb: Go Backwards on the Map! Similar to the map command, however, instead of displaying the next 20 locations, it displays the previous 20 locations. It's a way to go back.
Each subsequent call to map will display the next 20 locations, and so on.
- explore: Explore an Area and find the pokemons there.
- pokedex: Check which Pokemon you caught already and added to your Pokedex.
- exit: Exit the Pokedex
- help: Displays a help message.
